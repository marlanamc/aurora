# Focus Areas in Aurora OS (Starter Example)

Aurora OS organizes information and actions around **focus areas** rather than folders or task lists.
Focus areas are intentionally ADHD-friendly: **high-visual**, **low-friction**, and **shame-free**.

This document describes the “Classic Aurora” starter template. Everything is customizable in Settings (names, icons, add/remove areas, add/remove widgets).
