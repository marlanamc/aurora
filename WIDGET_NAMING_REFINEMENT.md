# Widget Naming Refinement - From Productivity to Gentle Encouragement

## Current Names That Feel Productivity-Focused

### 1. **"Heat Map"** → Suggested: **"Small Steps"** or **"Gentle Progress"**
**Why change**: "Heat" implies intensity, pressure, performance tracking
**Current description**: "A tiny momentum visual for consistency"
**New description**: "A gentle visual of small steps you've taken" or "See your progress without pressure"

### 2. **"Daily Quest"** → Suggested: **"One Small Thing"** or **"Today's Intention"**
**Why change**: "Quest" feels gamified, achievement-focused, like a task to complete
**Current description**: "One tiny time-boxed action"
**New description**: "One small thing you might do today (or not—that's okay too)"

### 3. **"Focus Timer"** → Suggested: **"Work Session"** or **"Time Box"** or **"Rest Timer"**
**Why change**: "Focus" implies you need to perform/focus, which can feel pressured
**Current description**: "25-minute timer for deep work sprints"
**New description**: "A gentle timer for work sessions (or rest breaks)" or "Set a timer, work or rest—your choice"

### 4. **"Recent Activity"** → Suggested: **"Recent Files"** or **"What You've Been Working With"**
**Why change**: "Activity" implies doing/tracking productivity
**Current description**: "A quick glance at recently changed files"
**New description**: "Files you've been working with recently" (more neutral, less tracking-focused)

### 5. **"Energy Tracker"** → Suggested: **"Energy Check-In"** or **"How Are You Feeling?"**
**Why change**: "Tracker" implies monitoring/measuring, can feel like surveillance
**Current description**: "Track your energy levels throughout the day"
