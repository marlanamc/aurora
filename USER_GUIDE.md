# Aurora OS - User Guide

Welcome to Aurora OS! This guide will help you get started with your visual memory layer.

## First Launch

When you first open Aurora OS, you'll see a welcome screen that guides you through:

1. **Understanding Aurora** - Learn what makes Aurora different
2. **Choosing Folders** - Select which folders to index
3. **Permissions** - Understand what macOS permissions Aurora needs

### Quick Start

1. **Add Folders**: Click "Add Folders" in the welcome screen or go to Settings → Content & Files
2. **Start Indexing**: Aurora will automatically scan your selected folders
3. **Explore**: Your files will appear as colorful tiles you can interact with

Aurora automatically resurfacing files you might have forgotten:
- **Forgotten**: Files you haven't opened in 14+ days

You can customize these in Settings → Core Values.

## Tips & Tricks

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`: Global search

### File Organization
- Use Finder tags - Aurora reads them automatically
- Files are organized by meaning, not just folders
- Use Core Values to group related work

### Performance
- Aurora indexes files in the background
- Large folders may take a few minutes to scan
- Subsequent scans are faster (only new/changed files)

## Troubleshooting

### Files Not Appearing
1. Check that folders are added in Settings → Content & Files
2. Click "Rescan Files" to trigger a new scan
3. Verify Full Disk Access is enabled in System Settings

### Calendar Not Showing
1. Check Calendar permission in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Calendars
2. Check Automation permission for Calendar access
3. Restart Aurora OS after enabling permissions

### Slow Performance
- Aurora indexes files in the background
- First scan of large folders takes time
- Subsequent scans are incremental and faster

### Reset Everything
- Go to Settings → General → Reset Defaults
- This clears all settings and starts fresh

## Privacy & Security

- **All data stays local**: Nothing is uploaded or synced
- **No cloud services**: Aurora works entirely on your Mac
- **No telemetry**: We don't track your usage
- **Open source**: You can audit the code yourself

## Getting Help

- Check this guide first
- Review the README.md for technical details
- File issues on GitHub (if applicable)

## What's Next?

Aurora is designed to grow with you. As you use it:
- Files become more meaningful through resurfacing
